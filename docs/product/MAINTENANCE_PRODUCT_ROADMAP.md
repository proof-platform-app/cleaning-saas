# MAINTENANCE_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md

**Status:** Strategic
**Owner:** Platform
**Scope impact:** None (does not modify V1 scope)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-15

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **evolution strategy** for the Maintenance context as an independent product.

It does **not** change V1 scope.
It does **not** authorize implementation work.
It defines direction only.

V1 boundaries remain governed by:

* `MAINTENANCE_CONTEXT_V1_SCOPE.md`
* `MAINTENANCE_PROOF_PARITY_PLAN.md`

---

## 2. Strategic Goal

Transform Maintenance from:

> “Cleaning-adapted execution layer”

into:

> “Asset-centric operational control system”

Maintenance is not cleaning with different labels.
It becomes an asset lifecycle product.

---

# Development Phases

---

# Stage 1 — Execution Parity (Foundation)

**Goal:** Reach structural parity with Cleaning execution layer.

This stage ensures:

* Visit lifecycle stability
* Proof enforcement
* SLA visibility
* PDF documentation

### Includes

* Checklist parity (P1)
* Evidence/photo parity (P2)
* Completion enforcement parity (P3)
* SLA UI parity (P4)
* Visit PDF report (P5)
* Asset History PDF (P6)

### Outcome

Maintenance becomes:

* Operationally enforceable
* Audit-ready
* Legally defensible
* Manager-trustworthy

No analytics expansion yet.
No intelligence layer yet.

---

# Stage 2 — Operational Visibility Layer

**Goal:** Make Maintenance measurable.

Once proof parity is closed, add visibility.

### Add

* Maintenance Dashboard (context-specific)
* SLA breach widget
* Overdue visits
* Preventive vs corrective ratio
* Technician workload (maintenance-only)
* Asset service frequency overview

### Add Reports

* Maintenance summary report
* Asset utilization report
* SLA breach report

This stage introduces:

> Monitoring layer

But still no predictive logic.

---

# Stage 3 — Asset Intelligence Layer

**Goal:** Move from visit-based to asset-based thinking.

Cleaning = job-centric
Maintenance = asset-centric

### Add

* Asset health status
* Last service age indicator
* Service interval tracking
* Recommended next service date
* Asset lifecycle timeline

### Introduce

* Maintenance schedules (preventive cycles)
* Auto-generation of visits based on intervals
* Escalation rules for overdue assets

Now the system becomes:

> Asset lifecycle manager

---

# Stage 4 — Proactive Maintenance System

**Goal:** Transition from reactive to predictive.

### Add

* Risk scoring per asset
* SLA breach probability
* Failure pattern tracking
* Usage-based maintenance triggers

Potential future integrations:

* IoT data ingestion
* External monitoring systems
* Asset performance analytics

At this stage Maintenance becomes:

> Operational infrastructure system

Not a task tracker.

---

# Navigation Evolution (Future)

After Stage 1 is complete, menu may expand to include:

* Dashboard
* Service Visits
* Assets
* Asset Types
* Technicians
* Analytics
* Reports
* Settings

But:

Navigation expansion happens only after:

* Proof parity closed
* SLA UI stable
* PDF reporting complete

---

# Architectural Principles

Maintenance must:

* Reuse Job engine (no new lifecycle states)
* Remain context-isolated
* Never modify Cleaning logic
* Keep shared enforcement layer centralized

Maintenance extends the platform.
It does not fork it.

---

# What This Document Does NOT Do

* Does not expand V1 scope
* Does not authorize implementation
* Does not override PRODUCT_BOUNDARY_LOCK
* Does not change API contracts

This is strategic direction only.

Implementation must still follow:

* Proof Parity Plan
* Context Isolation Lock
* Product Boundary Lock

---

# Success Definition

Maintenance becomes a standalone product when:

1. It no longer depends on Cleaning mental model.
2. It has its own dashboard and reporting layer.
3. Asset lifecycle management is core.
4. Preventive scheduling is automated.
5. Managers use it as infrastructure tool, not task list.

---

# Current Position

As of now:

Stage 1 — In Progress
Stage 2–4 — Not started

Focus remains on:

Closing Proof Parity completely before expanding.

# CleanProof — Sales Communication System

Audience: Cleaning companies (10–50 cleaners)  
Region: UAE  
Format: Recorded-first, async-only  
Language: English (simple, non-sales)

## Core Rule

We do not sell features.
We demonstrate proof.

If a company needs persuasion — it is not a fit.

---

## Funnel Structure

Landing page
→ Recorded demo
→ Short qualification
→ Pilot (1–2 locations)
→ Decision

No live demo by default.

---

## Positioning (Non-negotiable)

CleanProof is NOT:
- a CRM
- a scheduling system
- an analytics platform

CleanProof IS:
- a proof layer
- a dispute prevention system
- a verified PDF generator

Key sentence used everywhere:

"If it’s not proven — it didn’t happen."

---

## Communication Principles

- Short messages
- No marketing words
- No pressure
- No discounts
- No urgency framing

Tone:
Calm. Confident. Matter-of-fact.

---

## Who We Say NO To

- Companies asking for customization upfront
- Companies asking for integrations before pilot
- Companies asking “can we skip steps”
- Companies wanting flexibility instead of proof

---

## Success Signal

The product is successful when:
A manager forwards a CleanProof PDF to a client
and the dispute ends.

That is the only KPI at this stage.

# CleanProof — Recorded Demo Script (v1)

Duration: 7–10 minutes  
Audience: Cleaning companies (10–50 cleaners)  
Goal: Show proof, not convince

---

## Opening (30 seconds)

"CleanProof is not a CRM.
It is not a scheduling tool.

It is a proof layer.

If work isn’t proven — it didn’t happen."

---

## Problem (1 minute)

"Most cleaning disputes happen after the job is done.

Cleaners say:
‘It’s clean.’

Clients say:
‘It’s not.’

Photos in WhatsApp are not proof."

---

## Core Idea (30 seconds)

"In CleanProof, every step creates evidence.
Nothing can be skipped.

The result is one verified PDF report."

---

## Live Flow (4–5 minutes)

Show:
1. Job created (no explanation)
2. Cleaner check-in (GPS)
3. Before photos
4. Checklist (required)
5. After photos
6. Check-out (time + location)

Say:
"The cleaner cannot complete the job without proof.
Even if they want to."

---

## The Product (PDF) (2 minutes)

"This PDF is the product.

Not the app.
Not the dashboard.

This file."

Show:
- GPS
- Photos
- Checklist
- Duration

"This is what you send to your client."

---

## Filtering (1 minute)

"CleanProof works best for companies that:
- manage multiple cleaners
- have demanding clients
- want fewer arguments

If you need flexibility — this is not for you."

---

## Closing (30 seconds)

"The next step is a short pilot.
One or two locations.
No long-term commitment.

We only check one thing:
Does proof change the conversation?"

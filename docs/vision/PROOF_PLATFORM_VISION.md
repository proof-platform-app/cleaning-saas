# PROOF PLATFORM — VISION

## 1. What This Platform Is

Proof Platform is a **single infrastructure layer for verifying physical work**.

It exists to answer one question, consistently and objectively:

> **Was the work physically performed, at the right place, at the right time, and can this be proven later?**

The platform is not a task manager, not a CRM, not an automation system, and not project management software.

It is a **standard of proof** for any operation that requires a human visit to a physical location.

---

## 2. Core Ontology (Unchanging Reality Model)

Across all use cases, the platform models the same real‑world event:

* A human travels to a physical location
* At a specific point in time
* Performs work or inspection
* Produces verifiable evidence
* That evidence must remain immutable and auditable

This ontology does not change by industry.

Cleaning, inspections, maintenance, and site visits are **different contexts of the same physical event**, not different products.

---

## 3. The Proof Engine (Immutable Core)

All operational contexts rely on the same proof engine:

* GPS check‑in and check‑out
* Timestamped execution
* Before / After photo evidence
* Checklist as confirmation of performed actions
* Immutable audit history
* PDF report as the final legal / operational artifact

If industry labels are removed, **the engine remains identical**.

No context introduces its own lifecycle, proof rules, or execution logic.

---

## 4. Lifecycle (Fixed for All Contexts)

Every verified visit follows the same lifecycle:

```
scheduled → in_progress → completed
```

* Transitions are enforced server‑side
* Completed work becomes read‑only
* Proof artifacts cannot be modified retroactively

There are no alternative lifecycles per context.

---

## 5. What Changes Between Contexts (Configuration Only)

Differences between Cleaning, Property, Maintenance, and Fit‑out exist **only at the configuration layer**:

* Terminology (job, inspection, visit)
* Checklist templates
* Required checklist items
* Report wording and emphasis
* Which metrics are highlighted

These are **configurations applied over the same engine**, not separate logic paths.

---

## 6. What Never Changes (Hard Boundaries)

The following are non‑negotiable platform invariants:

* One backend engine, one database
* One lifecycle model
* One proof mechanism
* One audit trail model
* One report generation pipeline
* No per‑context backend conditionals
* No per‑industry exceptions

If a proposed feature violates any of these, it must be rejected.

---

## 7. Enterprise Value Proposition

Enterprise customers do not buy features.
They buy **standards**.

Proof Platform provides:

* A single standard of proof across operations
* A unified audit format
* A consistent reporting artifact
* A long‑term historical archive

This enables internal policy such as:

> “Any physical work is accepted only if verified through Proof Platform.”

This value is only possible because the platform is unified.

---

## 8. Operational Contexts (Not Products)

The platform supports multiple **operational contexts**:

* Commercial Cleaning
* Property / Asset Inspections
* Maintenance Services
* Construction & Fit‑out Site Visits

These contexts:

* Are not independent products
* Cannot exist without the core engine
* Do not evolve separately

They are **approved modes of using the same standard**.

---

## 9. Pricing Principle (Strategic Rule)

The platform is priced based on **scale and usage**, not on context count.

Pricing correlates with:

* Number of verified visits
* Number of locations / assets
* Active users
* Depth of historical retention
* Audit and reporting requirements

Operational contexts are enabled as configurations, not sold as separate SKUs.

---

## 10. Explicit Non‑Goals

The platform will never become:

* Task management software
* Workflow automation engine
* Real‑time tracking system
* Payroll or HR system
* Client portal platform
* Project management tool

Any request pushing in these directions must be declined.

---

## 11. Guiding Principle

> **We are not building tools for doing work.
> We are building infrastructure for proving work was done.**

All decisions — technical, product, commercial — must reinforce this principle.

## Status

* Document type: Vision / Architectural Anchor
* Audience: Internal (Founder, Architecture, AI Agents)
* Change policy: Rare, explicit, intentional

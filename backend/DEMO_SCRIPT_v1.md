# CleanProof — Demo Call Script (v1)

**Status:** v1  
**Audience:** Founder / Sales  
**Scope:** Demo & qualification only  
**Not a marketing document**
    

**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Format:** Live guided demo (screen share)
**Goal:** Not to sell. To establish a single source of truth.

> CleanProof is not a CRM and not a scheduling tool.
> It is a proof layer. If work isn’t proven — it didn’t happen.

---

## Demo Principle

This demo is designed to:

* show **real product behavior**, not simulated flows;
* create contrast between *promises* and *facts*;
* filter out customers who need flexibility instead of proof.

No features are shown that are not backed by real system behavior.

---

## 0. Entry & Expectation Alignment (1 minute)

**You say:**

> Before we start — just one sentence to align expectations.
> CleanProof is not a CRM and not a scheduling tool.
> It’s a proof layer. If work isn’t proven, it didn’t happen.

Pause. Watch their reaction.

* If they nod — continue.
* If they hesitate — stop. The demo will not be productive.

---

## 1. Client Context (1–2 minutes)

**You ask:**

> Quick question.
> When a client disputes cleaning quality — what do you show them?

Typical answers:

* WhatsApp photos
* Cleaner messages
* Nothing solid

**You respond:**

> Right. And that’s the problem.
> Photos without time, location, and process aren’t proof.

---

## 2. The Promise (30 seconds)

**You say:**

> In CleanProof, no step can be skipped.
> Every action creates evidence.
> The result is one verified PDF report — and that’s the only thing that matters.

---

## 3. Live Flow — Manager → Job Creation (2 minutes)

*(Web interface)*

**You say:**

> I create a job.
> Location, cleaner, time. That’s it.

**Key emphasis:**

> Nothing interesting happens here.
> Proof starts on site — not in the dashboard.

Avoid explaining UI details. Do not oversell.

---

## 4. Live Flow — Cleaner → Job Execution (5 minutes)

*(Mobile interface — core of the demo)*

### Check-in

**You say:**

> Cleaner arrives on site.
> Check-in captures GPS and time.
> If they’re not there — it simply doesn’t work.

### Before Photo

**You say:**

> Photo is taken on site.
> Timestamped. Location attached.

### Checklist

**You say:**

> Checklist isn’t a suggestion.
> It’s required.
> If something isn’t checked — the job can’t be completed.

### After Photo

**You say:**

> Same rules. No shortcuts.

### Check-out

**You say:**

> Check-out records time and location again.
> Now the system knows how long the job actually took.

**Pause.**

**You conclude:**

> At this point, the cleaner can’t lie — even if they want to.

---

## 5. The Artifact — PDF Report (3 minutes)

*(Open the generated PDF)*

**You say:**

> This is the product.
> Not the app. Not the dashboard.
> This PDF.

Show explicitly:

* GPS verification
* Before / after photos
* Completed checklist
* Time spent

**Key line:**

> This report is the final source of truth.
> You can send it to a client, property manager, or keep it for disputes.

## 6. Contrast (1 minute)

**You say:**

> Before CleanProof, cleaning is a promise.
> After CleanProof, it’s a fact.

Pause.

---

## 7. Qualification & Filtering (1 minute)

**You say:**

> This works best for companies that:
>
> * manage multiple cleaners
> * work with demanding clients
> * need proof, not explanations

> If you’re looking for something flexible or highly customizable — this won’t be a fit.

This is intentional filtering.

---

## 8. Closing (1–2 minutes)

**You say:**

> If this solves a real problem for you,
> the next step is a short pilot with one or two locations.

> No long-term commitment.
> We just check if proof changes the conversation with your clients.

---

## Language Rules (Strict)

**Do NOT say:**

* automation
* analytics
* AI
* productivity
* optimize

**Always say:**

* proof
* verified
* cannot be skipped
* source of truth
* disputes

## Summary

* fully aligns with the CleanProof landing and demo pages;
* reflects real system behavior only;
* avoids feature promises beyond current capabilities;
* filters out misaligned customers;
* positions CleanProof as a proof layer — not an all-in-one system.

**Status:** v1 — validated against current product and API behavior.
